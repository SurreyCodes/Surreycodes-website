          <h1>We are preparing the developers of the future</h1>
          <p>Our students learn by doing. They prepare, code and improve web applications for good. By doing this, non-profits in British Columbia benefits of having low-cost websites and apps. At the same time, our students build a portfolio of real-wold experiences.</p>
          <p>Each place in our full time program costs about $4,000.00 to provide. We do our best to keep these costs low and cultivate high quality developers at the same time.</p>
          <h1>Your contribution creates a 10x effect.</h1>
          <p>High quality graduates will look up to your company. And non-profits will have more budget to do good.</p>
